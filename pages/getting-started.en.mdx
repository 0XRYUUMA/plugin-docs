# Getting started

Install Figma Tokens by hitting the `Install` button on [this page](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/843461159747178978/Figma-Tokens) (either in Figma or in the browser)

This will install the plugin for you.

If you launch the plugin for the very first time, you won't have any tokens defined just yet. Click on `Get started` to get started.

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'


<ReactPlayer
  muted
  width="100%"
  height="auto"
  loop
  playing
  controls
  url="/getting-started.mp4"
/>


Then, you can proceed in one of the following ways:

- Create your own tokens via the UI
- Import your existing styles into Tokens
- Create tokens via the JSON editor
