### What are design tokens?
> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system â€” specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.
[Salesforce, Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/)

Design Tokens originated at Salesforce, where [Jina](https://twitter.com/jina) and [Jon](https://twitter.com/jonnyl) coined the term. A good explanation can be found on [Jina Anne's Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qIowMyVt8)

### Installing the plugin

Install Figma Tokens by hitting the `Install` button on [this page](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/843461159747178978/Figma-Tokens) (either in Figma or in the browser)

If you launch the plugin for the very first time, you won't have any tokens defined just yet. Click on `Get started` to get started.

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'


<ReactPlayer
  muted
  width="100%"
  height="auto"
  loop
  playing
  controls
  url="/getting-started.mp4"
/>


Then, you can proceed in one of the following ways:

- Create your own tokens via the UI
- Import your existing styles into Tokens
- Create tokens via the JSON editor
