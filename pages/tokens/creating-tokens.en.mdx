# Creating tokens

In Tokens Studio for Figma, you can create reusable and semantic tokens which you can then reference in your design process.

Creating a new token via the UI is a simple process. As an example, create a new token in the Colors group by clicking on the `+` icon in the `Colors` group.

In the modal that appears, give your token a name, for example `colors.blue` with a value of `#0000FF`, save your progress by clicking `Create`.

### Editing tokens
To change the value of an existing token, right click the token you wish to edit and select `Edit Token`.

You can also change the name of the token, which will automatically update all references to this token.

### Duplicating tokens
To duplicate a token, right click the token you wish to duplicate and select `Duplicate Token`.

### Token groups
As having a lot of tokens can become quite messy, you can nest tokens by using a dot-notation in their name, for example `colors.button.background.primary`.

You can remove token groups by right-clicking them and selecting `Delete` which will remove all tokens under that group.
