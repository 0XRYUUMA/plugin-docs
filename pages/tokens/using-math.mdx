# Color Tokens

Color tokens make up a big part of Figma Tokens, as they're so tightly integrated with Figma's styles but give you options that Styles don't offer (yet).

You can use color tokens for various things:

- Updating color styles
- Creating color styles
- Applying a fill color
- Applying a stroke color

There are multiple ways you can write color tokens:

- Hex: `#ff0000`
- RGB: `rgb(255, 0, 0)`
- RGBA: `rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)`
- HSLA: `hsla(120, 50, 50, 1)`

By default, a token references a Solid Paint (single colors).
