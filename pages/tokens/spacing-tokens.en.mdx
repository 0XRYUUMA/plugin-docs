# Spacing Tokens

Spacing tokens give you the ability to define values for Auto Layout that you can reuse. Once you applied a spacing token to a layer, it will get updated whenever you change that token, so any layer containing a reference to `{spacing.container}` will get updated, when you update that specific token.

#### How to use

In order to make spacing tokens work, start by creating tokens in the Spacing category.

Then, select or create an `Auto Layout` layer (it will not work on any other layer type!)

Once selected, apply Spacing tokens by either left-clicking (all values will use this token) or right-click to specify which part of the Auto Layout you want to target (`gap`, `horizontal` or `vertical`. Others are following soon)
