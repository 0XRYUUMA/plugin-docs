# Applying tokens

There are two ways how you can apply tokens to your selection:

### Default behaviour (left-click)
When you left-click a token this token is being put on your selection (multiple layers selected are possible!). For certain tokens we assume defaults, such as for `Colors` we assume you want to apply `Fill`.

### Specifying what to apply (right-click)
You can right-click tokens to specify what property should be set, such as in `Spacing` the `Left`, `Top`, `Right`, `Bottom` or `Gap` properties individually

### Control where to apply changes
You can control what parts of your design get updated by utilizing the Apply selector in the bottom left of the plugin. You can choose between
- Apply to page (currently selected page will get updated)
- Apply to document (all pages get updated, possibly slow)
- Apply to selection (only the currently selected nodes will get updated)

Also, we give you more control what happens after you change a token. By setting `Update on change` to false, the plugin will require you to manually press the `Update` button to send changes to your page/document/selection.
