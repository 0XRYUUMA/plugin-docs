# Using Math

A lot of times it may make sense to build your tokens with a scale in mind, such as a type scale or a spacing scale. What that means, is that a value uses another value, but does calculations with it.

For example, you may want your `spacing.sm` token reference the `spacing.xs` token, but multiply its value by 2. To do that, you can write the following as the token's value: `{spacing.xs} * 2` (note the space between token and value)

You can also multiply with another token: `{spacing.xs} * {spacing.scale}`

where `spacing.scale` would be a token who's value could be for example 2.

Other use cases where this is helpful could be typography with font sizes referencing the previous token and multiply that with a type scale of e.g. 1.25.

### Adding units
The plugin cannot calculate if one of your tokens had the unit included (e.g. `spacing.sm = 2rem`). In that case you can either decide to remove the unit or append the unit after the operation (e.g. `{spacing.xs} * {spacing.scale}rem`)
