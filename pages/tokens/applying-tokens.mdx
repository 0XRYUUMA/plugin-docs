# Applying tokens

There are two ways how you can apply tokens to your selection:

### Default behaviour (left-click)
When you left-click a token this token is being put on your selection (multiple layers selected are possible!). For certain tokens we assume defaults, such as for `Colors` we assume you want to apply `Fill`.

### Specifying what to apply (right-click)
You can right-click tokens to specify what property should be set, such as in `Spacing` the `Horizontal Spacing`, `Vertical Spacing` or `Gap` properties individually
