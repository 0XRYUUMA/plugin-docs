# Creating tokens

Creating a new token via the UI is a simple process. As an example, create a new token in the Fill group by clicking on the `+` icon in the `Fill` group.

In the modal that appears, give your token a name, for example `blue` with a value of `#0000FF`, save your progress by clicking `Create`.

### Editing tokens
To change the value of an existing token, right click the token you wish to edit and select `Edit Token`.

You can also change the name of the token, which will automatically update all references to this token.

### Token groups
As having a lot of tokens can become quite messy, you can group your tokens by adding them to a token group. There's two ways how you can do that:

#### Create a new token group
Go to the Edit Tokens dialog of the property you want to create a group for and then hit the `Add a new group` button.

#### Create a new group by adding a new token
When you add a new token, you can simply write your tokens in dot-seperated names. Naming your new token `primary.500` will add this new token to the group `primary` and with a name of `500`.
