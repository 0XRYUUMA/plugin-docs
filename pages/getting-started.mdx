# Getting started

## Installation

Install Figma Tokens by hitting the `Install` button on [this page](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/843461159747178978/Figma-Tokens) (either in Figma or in the browser)

This will install the plugin for you.

## First launch

If you launch the plugin for the very first time, you won't have any tokens defined just yet. Click on `Configure Tokens` to get started.

Then, you can proceed in one of the following ways:

- Create your own tokens via the UI
- Import your existing styles into Tokens
- Add a JSON representation of your own token set.
